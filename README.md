# SwiftKilo
A Swift port of Kilo, the C editor written in about 1000 lines of code.

This is mostly for funsies, but is a functional text editor. I'm writing it by following along with [this](http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) long tutorial and working out how things work in Swift. I'm also slowly converting bits of the code into more Swift-like designs when I'm fairly confident it's actually helping.

If you like non-Xcode Swift projects, text editors, or unsafe bits of Swift, maybe this is interesting to look at.






# Contributing:

I'm not really interested in whatever cool feature you implement. But if you did have ideas on how to make things more Swift-like, I'd be happy to see your PR's. This project isn't for profit, you're free to fork it and do whatever you want, go nuts! The original project wasn't even my idea in the first place, haha.
